I just filed [an issue](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/2754) there.",

Many deployments of\r\n   Zstandard operate in controlled, private environments and can\r\n   directly communicate with their encoder and decoder to negotiate a\r\n   higher or lower limit.",

My only concern is that RFC 8878 is *primarily* the most visible source of truth document for specifying the Zstandard wire format, and then there is one small section that registers that format as a content-encoding. I want to avoid a misinterpretation where this document appears to modify the guidance for *all* Zstandard streams. So I might suggest a little rewording in a different PR. But that certainly doesn't block this removal.",
