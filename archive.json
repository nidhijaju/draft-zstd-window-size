We may want to clarify the window limits for that scheme as well (either in this draft or in the CDT draft).\r\n\r\nProbably the right answer is something like 8 MB or 2 * the dictionary size if one is in use, to allow delta-ing of larger resources.",

I just filed [an issue](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/2754) there.",
