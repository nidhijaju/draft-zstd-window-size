              Window Sizing for Zstandard Content Encoding
               draft-jaju-httpbis-zstd-window-size-latest

Abstract

   Deployments of Zstandard, or "zstd", can use different window sizes
   to limit memory usage during compression and decompression.  Some
   browsers and user agents limit window sizes to mitigate memory usage
   concerns, causing interoperability issues.  This document updates the
   window size limit in RFC8878 from a recommendation to a requirement
   in HTTP contexts.

1.  Introduction

   Zstandard, or "zstd", specified in [RFC8878], is a lossless data
   compression mechanism similar to gzip.  When used with HTTP, the
   "zstd" Content Encoding token signals to the decoder that the content
   is Zstandard-compressed.

   Deployments of Zstandard can use different window sizes to configure
   the maximum memory a decoder requires to decompress a frame.  Larger
   window sizes tend to improve the compression ratio, but cause more
   memory to be used.  [RFC8878] provides a recommendation for decoders
   to support window sizes up to 8 MB, and for encoders to not generate
   frames requiring window sizes larger than 8 MB.  However, it is just
   a recommendation ([RFC8878], Section 3.1.1.1.2).

   To protect against unreasonable memory usage, some browsers and user
   agents limit the maximum window size allowed.  This causes
   incompatibilities if the content is compressed with a larger limit,
   leading to decreased interoperability.

   This document updates [RFC8878] to specify a window size limit
   associated with the "zstd" Content Encoding token.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Window Size

   Section 3.1.1.1.2 of [RFC8878] discusses window sizes in Zstandard.
   The window size provides guarantees about the minimum memory buffer
   required to decompress a frame.  This information is important for
   decoders to allocate enough memory.

   The minimum window size is 1 KB.  The maximum window size is (1<<41)
   + 7*(1<<38) bytes, which is 3.75 TB.

   In general, larger window size values tend to improve the compression
   ratio, but at the cost of increased memory usage.

   To properly decode compressed data, a decoder will need to allocate a
   buffer of at least the window size bytes.

   In order to protect decoders from unreasonable memory requirements, a
   decoder is allowed to reject a compressed frame that requests a
   memory size beyond the decoder's authorized range.

   To maintain interoperability of Zstandard in HTTP Content Encoding,
   decoders MUST support window sizes of up to and including 8 MB and
   encoders MUST NOT generate frames requiring a window size of larger
   than 8 MB, when using the "zstd" Content Encoding token (see
   Section 5.1).

4.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   discussed in [RFC8878].

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Content Encoding

   This document updates the entry added in [RFC8878] to the "HTTP
   Content Coding Registry" within the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol
   (HTTP) Parameters" registry:

   Name:  zstd

   Description:  A stream of bytes compressed using the Zstandard
      protocol with a window size of not more than 8 MB.
